# PyPw
A password manager, made with python. 

## Usage

Run the script like this:
`python pypw.py`
The script will ask for a file. If you already have a password file stored (i.e. you have already used the program before), just input that as the filename. Otherwise, you will have to add accounts and passwords to the file using the program. Don't forget that the file isn't saved until you quit using 'q'.
